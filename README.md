# Berlin Road Accident Analysis & Severity Prediction



Analysis of Berlin Road Accidents and Predicting the Accident Severity
**********************************************************************

Goal
****
Safety is one of the most important factors which needs to be considered when evaluating a road network. In this project I will be analyzing Berlin road accidents which happened during 2018 and 2021 and identifying the key factors contributing to road accidents, trends involving different types of vehicles. I will determine where a high percentage of serious injury and fatalities occur in Berlin and create a model which will predict the accident severity based on certain conditions. 

The results of this project could be used to:
- improve road signage
- improve road infrastructure at high risk areas
- help medical personnel to respond accurately to certain situations (allocate appropriate resources, equipment, etc.)
